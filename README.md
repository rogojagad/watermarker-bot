# Watermarker Bot

Recently, Indonesian Ministry of Communication and Informatics release a <a href="https://twitter.com/kemkominfo/status/1432675008963170308" target="_blank">tweet</a> about how to anticipate unwanted party to misused our personal data.

Seems much effort is needed (well, at least for me)

Being a programmer myself, I decide to work on something to make those steps easier (well again, at least for me personally).

## How It Works
- You send image of your personal identification document you want to bookmark to this bot
- This bot will ask for the text you want to use as the watermark text
- This bot will return the watermarked image to you
- This bot **will not** store any of your image you sent, **but** as how the Telegram chat server mechanism works, your image will still be saved in the **Telegram server**, **not mine**. 
- That mechanism mentioned above is **default** Telegram chat server mechanism works when you send image, not only specific for this bot.  
- This bot works with the same purpose on the tips given by the ministry, this watermarking image process **will not** guarantee that your personal data image is safe from being stolen by unwanted party. **But** this mechanism hopefully will make us know from which platform our data is stolen and hopefully making it less useful because of the watermark.

Explanation above acts as a brief explanation for you so you can deduce the pros and cons of this bot.

## Tech Stack
- Node.js
- Typescript
- Sharp (image processor library)
- Telegram Bot Api (Telegram Bot library)

## Thanks To:
- Indonesian Ministry of Communication and Informatics for inspiring me to made this simple bot
